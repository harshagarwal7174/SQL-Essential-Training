# SQL Essential Training ‚Äì Example Queries

Welcome! This repository is a collection of well-explained, practical SQL queries created as part of my SQL Essential Training journey. All queries are clearly commented and organized by topic for easy reference and learning.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `filters/`
  - Contains example queries illustrating basic data selection and filtering (e.g., by date, amount, or city).
- `joins/`
  - Demonstrates various types of table joins for combining data across tables.
- `groupings/`
  - Shows use of aggregation, GROUP BY, HAVING, and performance comparisons.
- `views/`
  - Examples on how to create, modify, and use SQL views.
- `data_manipulation/`
  - Covers INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries for data modification.
- `advanced/`
  - Includes subqueries, nested queries, and advanced SQL techniques.

## üöÄ How to Use

- Browse the folders above.
- Each `.sql` file focuses on a specific concept and starts with header comments explaining what it does and why.
- To run a query, open the file in your SQL editor (such as MySQL Workbench) and execute it.
- All files are standalone: you can review, copy, or adapt any query for your own practice.

## üí° Notes

- **No numerical prefixing:** All files in each topic folder are named by their main function or topic (e.g., `filter_invoices_by_date_and_amount.sql`, `invoice_customer_join.sql`).
- Code comments at the top of each file provide explanation and usage.
- This project demonstrates applied SQL skills as part of my learning path.
